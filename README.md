Rename env.sample to .env and populate it with your data.

To self host the bot, you're going to need to host [the version API.](https://github.com/shinyzenith/discord-version-api)
You can contact me if you need an API key to [my instance](https://api.shinyzenith.xyz/).

Best way to host the API is to use docker compose and set the api url to http://yourservicename in the .env file.
